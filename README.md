# Wrangling-and-Analayzing-Data-Project

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, 
then clean it. This is called data wrangling. 
I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
